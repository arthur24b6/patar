Barnsligipt is a javascript slideshow which uses JPEG EXIF thumbnails to provide low bandwidth content for large images.

Barnsligipt uses Apache's (or GitHub's) directory listing to build a list of images which it will use in the slideshow. EXIF thumbnail is used to populate the small image sizes if present.
